# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Overview
This project is a handwritten digit classification system using deep learning. The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to classify the input image into one of these digits.

## Features
- Uses a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.
- Implements the MNIST dataset for training and validation.
- Includes various MATLAB and Python scripts for dataset handling, model training, and prediction.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shit-happens/Handwritten-Digit-Classifier.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - Python: `tensorflow`, `numpy`
   - MATLAB: Required for running the provided `.m` scripts.
3. Run the `mnist_cnn.py` file for model training and digit classification.

## Usage
- Run the model training script to train the CNN on the MNIST dataset.
- Use `predict.m` for making predictions on new input images.

For more details, check the respective scripts in the repository.
